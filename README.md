# Tic tac toe
c# basic tic tac toe game

This is using classes, but doesnt implement advanced oop stuff like inheritance or abstraction (though I don't think its needed).
Uses a big switch case for the logic which is also probably not the best way to do it. 
Saw a java video where they used 2d arrays for possible board states which does seem better, but I also havent learned about lists or tuples and stuff like that yet (just regular arrays).

Go to Program.cs for the actual code (rest is autogenerated boilerplate)

Anyways like and favourite if you agree!!!!!
